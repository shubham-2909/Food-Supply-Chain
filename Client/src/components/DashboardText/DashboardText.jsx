            <b>DeTrace</b> is a decentralized supply chain management system
            that allows you to efficiently manage the product distribution chain
            efficiently yet easily.
            <br />
            It begins at the root level where the manufacturer registers a
            product with the system. When the product is released in the market,
            it is sold to a retailer for a predefined price. A customer can then
            purchase this product from the retailer. All of these transactions
            are recorded in the blockchain and this makes the product flow more
            transparent.
            <br />
            The entire history of a product is also displayed to the users,
            where they can see how the product has been handed along since the
            product was manufactured. This prevents the introduction of
            counterfeit products in the market. This can be especially useful
            for keeping track of medicines and branded products.
